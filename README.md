# Webpack Project Demo - Restaurant Demo #

[Live Demo](https://pataskad.github.io/restaurant-homepage/)

This is a practice project that utililizes the webpack workflow and content management methodology to produce an smooth pipeline for either one or a team of developers to keep the primary focus on the underlying product quality, instead of repetitive tasks. The content of this project is of relatively low importance compared to other projects as the focus of this project is about setting up webpack to demonstrate not only my own comprehension of the tool, but also a demonstration of just some of the core features of webpack and what it brings to the industry.
